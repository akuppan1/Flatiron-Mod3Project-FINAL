# Telco Customer Churn Analysis and Recommendations

## What this project is about:
  We were tasked to analyze a telecom company's customer data in order help them mitigate their customer churn rate.

## Summary
  We saw that there indeed was a pattern for churn. Customers who churned were usually people with month-to-month contracts and churned within the first 12 months of their contract. We based our recommendations on this observation as well as others found in the data.
